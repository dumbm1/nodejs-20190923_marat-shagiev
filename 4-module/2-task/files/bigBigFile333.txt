Warmness on the Soul

[Verse 1]
Your hazel-green tint eyes watching
Every move I make
And that feeling of doubt,
It's erased
I'll never feel alone again
With you by my side
You're the one
And in you I confide more

[Verse 2]
And we have gone through good and bad
Times
But your unconditional love
Was always on my mind
You've been there from the start for me
And your love's always been
True as can be

[chorus]
I give my heart to you
I give my heart 'cause nothing
Can compare in this world to you

[Verse 2]
[chorus*2]
